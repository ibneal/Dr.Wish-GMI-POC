# Dr.Wish-GMI-POC
This script analyzes stock market data to calculate various market health indicators, including a 10-day new high index for QQQ stocks, the number of 52-week highs across NYSE and NASDAQ stocks, and performance comparisons for top holdings in QQQ and SPY indices. It processes data for specified trading days, excluding holidays, and compiles the results into a comprehensive market health score called the GMI (Global Market Indicator). The script utilizes the Polygon.io API to fetch stock price data and stores the results in a database for further analysis and tracking of market trends over time.
